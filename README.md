# Statisk
A library for data-driven static site generators.

## Introduction

Data driven like Reitit, open but suggestive of structure using the `pull -> transform -> push` methodology as conceptualized by Zach Tellman in [_Elements of Clojure_](https://elementsofclojure.com).

Statisk is completely dependency free.
